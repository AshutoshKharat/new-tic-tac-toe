# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with PHP, HTML, MySQL, and JavaScript (using jQuery). This project allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe, and stores the game state in a MySQL database.

## Features

1) Classic Tic Tac Toe game with a 3x3 grid.
2) Players take turns between X and O.
3) Stores each move and the game's progress in a MySQL database.
4) Detects wins, losses, and draws.
5) Reset functionality to restart the game.
6) Simple dark-themed interface with Bootstrap for styling.

## Requirements

- PHP (>= 7.4 or 8.x)
- MySQL (or MariaDB)
- Apache/Nginx web server (XAMPP/WAMP for local development)
- Composer (for package management)
- jQuery (for handling AJAX requests)

## Installation

  1. Clone the Repository
     ```cli
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
     cd tic-tac-toe
      ```
2. Set Up Database

   Create a MySQL database (e.g., tictactoe_db). Import the SQL schema provided below:

     ```
    CREATE DATABASE tictactoe_db;
    USE tictactoe_db;
    
    CREATE TABLE tic_tac_toe (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        board_state TEXT,
        current_player VARCHAR(1),
        next_player VARCHAR(1)
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE winners (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        winner VARCHAR(1),
        board_state TEXT
    );
     ```
3. Configure Database

   Edit the database configuration inside the Database.php file:

     ```
     class Database {
         private $connection;
         public function __construct() {
             $this->connection = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "tictactoe_db");
             if ($this->connection->connect_error) {
                 die("Connection failed: " . $this->connection->connect_error);
             }
         }
     }
     ```

Ensure the connection details match your local MySQL setup (username, password, and database name).

4. Set Up Apache/Nginx

   1) Place the project in your web server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).
   2) Start your Apache or Nginx server.
   3) Open the application in your browser (e.g., http://localhost/tic-tac-toe/).

5. Dependencies

   Using Composer 
   If you are using Composer, run:
     ``` 
     composer install
     ```

6. Playing the Game

   - Open the Tic Tac Toe application in your browser.
   - The first player is X.
   - Click on the grid to make a move.
   - The game will detect a winner or draw and display the result.
   - Use the Reset Game button to start a new game.

## How It Works
- index.php: Displays the Tic Tac Toe board and handles front-end interactions with the game.
- TicTacToe.php: Contains the core game logic such as move validation, player switching, winner detection, and game reset.
- Database.php: Connects to MySQL and stores game states and player moves.
- SessionManager.php: Handles the PHP session, ensuring game state is stored between requests.
- process_move.php: Processes moves sent from the front-end via AJAX, updates the game state, and returns the response.
- reset_game.php: Resets the game state, clearing the session and database records.

## AJAX Interaction
When a player clicks a tile, an AJAX request is sent to process_move.php, which handles the following:

- Checks if the move is valid.
- Updates the board with the current player's symbol.
- Switches to the next player.
- Checks for a winner or a draw.

## Resetting the Game
The Reset Game button sends an AJAX request to reset_game.php, which:
- Clears the session and database entries.
- Restores the game to its initial state.
